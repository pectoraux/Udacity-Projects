# Udacity

This repository holds the Six projects completed in Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. These projects are the following:

* Titanic Survival Exploration  

In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.

* Boston Housing Dataset

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

* Student Intervention System

Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.

* Customer Segment Analysis
 
Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

* Train a Smartcab to Drive

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

* Predicting Parole Violators  

In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from the United States 2004 National Corrections Reporting Program; a census across all the United States of parole releases that occurred during 2004. We limited our focus to parolees who served no more than 6 months in prison and whose maximum sentence for all charges did not exceed 18 months.
A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about prisonners who should obtain parole and ultimately solve the problem of prisons overcrowding.
