    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Education at all levels has been undergoing a tremendous amount of change over the last several years. There was a time when the only way to access information was by sifting through books in a library. Today, a student can obtain an encyclopedia's worth of information with a few clicks of a mouse. Companies like Coursera, Udacity, and Khan Academy are democratizing education, while universities are rethinking the traditional approach and incorporating technology to diversify their offerings. As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, there has been an accompanying influx of data, with logs of student activities, grades, and interactions with teachers and fellow students all available in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of an educator, this data offers a lot of potential. It can be used to understand how different students learn, which in turn may help identify new ways of predicting success and failure. If these predictions can be made early enough, then effective interventions can be made in a timely manner to ensure the student has the best chance of succeeding. Universities are now even beginning to offer Netflix-like [course recommendations](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-hastings-effect-how-the-netflix-big-data-approach-is) to their students!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I seek to model the factors that best predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam. My goal is to identify students who might need early intervention. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem, because I am predicting a binary response: Either the student passes (and does not need an intervention), or the student does not pass (and does require an intervention).\n"

The Decision Tree Classifier does not generalize well and that fact is confirmed here by our little experiment.    \n",
